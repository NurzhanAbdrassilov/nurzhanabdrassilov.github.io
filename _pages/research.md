I’m currently part of a research group led by Professor John D. Kubiatowicz ("Kubi") at UC Berkeley, working closely with PhD students **Alex Thomas** and **Shubham Mishra**.  
Our research focuses on **secure distributed systems** running on **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, with the goal of enabling **stateful, confidential computation across disaggregated hardware**.

We're exploring how to build distributed protocols that maintain strong security guarantees like integrity, confidentiality, and rollback protection—even in the presence of compromised infrastructure. The work spans systems design, enclave security, and performance benchmarking.

This research is still in progress, and I’ll be updating this page as our work evolves.  
In the meantime, you can follow along with what I’ve been working on in the [blog](/blog/) section.
