- Engineered a fully functional single-core Operating System in C, including comprehensive design documentation
- Developed interrupt handling, including 27 system calls, enabling context switching and service for threads
- Built robust multithreading functionality with dynamic stack allocation, using various synchronization primitives, including locks, semaphores, and condition variables, implemented from scratch
- Designed an efficient OS scheduler supporting FIFO, Round Robin, and Strict Priority Scheduling techniques, enabling synchronous thread execution on a single CPU core
