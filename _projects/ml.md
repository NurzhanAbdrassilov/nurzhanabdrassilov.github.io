Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models. Key models developed:
-Support Vector Machines (SVM): Trained classifiers on MNIST and Spam datasets using scikit-learn, tuned hyperparameters, and achieved 98.5% accuracy on MNIST and 90% accuracy on the Spam test set
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis: Implemented LDA and QDA classifiers from scratch on MNIST and spam datasets using maximum likelihood estimation; visualized class-wise covariance matrices, evaluated model performance across training sizes, and achieved 94.5% and 87.7% test accuracy for MNIST and Spam datasets, respectively
- Logistic Regression: Implemented logistic regression, batch/stochastic gradient descent with L2 regularization, and learning rate scheduling from scratch to predict red vs. white wine; achieved 100% test set accuracy
- Decision Trees & Random Forest: Implemented decision tree classifiers from scratch and built a random forest using bagged decision trees to predict spam emails and Titanic survival; handled missing data, visualized tree decisions, and achieved 82% and 78% test accuracy for spam and Titanic datasets, respectively
- Neural Networks & Deep Learning: Implemented fully connected and convolutional neural networks from scratch using NumPy and PyTorch; built custom forward/backward propagation, batch normalization, and convolution layers, and achieved 93.9% test accuracy on the CIFAR dataset
